<ol>
  <li><strong>Silencing</strong> (protection from acoustic mines) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>To protect from acoustic mines, make the ship run quiet.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Degaussing</strong> (protection from magnetic mines) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>To protect from magnetic mines, minimize the ship's magnetic field.
      <ul>
        <li>Periodically wrap ship in wires and neutralize the magnetic field.</li>
        <li>Process known as degaussing.  Must measure ship's magnetic signature periodically and monitor it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Steaming slowly</strong> (protection from pressure mines)
<ul>
      <li>To protect from pressure or seismic activated mines, steam slowly. </li>

<p class="ListTitle">Clearing/Removing Mines</p>

  <li><strong>Mine Sweeping</strong> (done to neutralize a large area)
    <ul>
      <li>Cut cables then activate to destroy (moored mines)
        <ul>
          <li>Sweeping for moored mines involves cutting the mooring cable and letting mines float to the surface where they are destroyed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use acoustic/magnetic noisemakers to activate
        <ul>
          <li>Acoustic and magnetic mines are detonated by dragging noisemakers through the water which causes the mines to detonate.</li>

<p><em>Example Mine Hunting Systems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV)</strong></p>
<div align="center"><img src="rmmv.png" width="300" height="309" /></div>
<p>To help respond to the growing threat of moored and bottom mines, U.S. Navy officials and Lockheed Martin engineers developed the AN/WLD-1 Remote Mine hunting System (RMS). The RMMV, a mission-configurable, unmanned, semi-submersible, semi-autonomous vehicle, is the integral mobile system of this premier, 
persistent mine hunting system.

<p><strong>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) REMUS</strong></p>
<div align="center"><img src="remus.png" width="400" height="85" /></div>
<p>Remus is a combat proven AUV and was used by Mine Countermeasures forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom. It can also be used to help safeguard vital U.S. ports and harbors against maritime terrorist threats.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System (RAMICS)</strong></p>
<div align="center"><img src="ramics.png" width="400" height="242" /></div>
<p>Low-tech underwater mines are easy to place undetected, but are powerful enough to damage modern warships. To clear these hazards, Northrop Grumman is developing a helicopter-based technology, called the Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System (RAMICS). It locates mines with laser scanners and destroys them with super cavitating cannon rounds that can cut through water. The tip creates a shock wave that vaporizes the water ahead of the projectile. The round effectively travels inside a dry tube of vapor slightly wider than itself, and can detonate mines at depths greater than 40 feet. The next stage in the program is to mount the gun and sensor on an MH-60 helicopter for flight testing. Development should be complete in 2013, with the system entering 
service in 2015.</p>
