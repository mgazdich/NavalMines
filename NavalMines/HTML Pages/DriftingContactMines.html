<p class="LargeTitle">Drifting Contact Mines</p>
<p>Sometimes moored contact mines break from their moorings and become drifting mines carried by currents and tides; modern mines are designed to deactivate in this event. After several years at sea, however, the deactivation mechanism might not function as intended and the mines may remain live.</p>
<p>The U.S. does not use drifting mines. Drifting mines are the mines you heard about in Gulf war with photos of sailors detonating the drifting mines with rifles. With drifting mines you do not need to go into an area to plant them. </p>
