<p class="LargeTitle">Influence Mines</p>
<p>Influence mines can be bottom or moored weapons and have sophisticated sensors and firing mechanisms that do not require the target to make contact with the mine before the mine explodes. They are fitted with just one or combinations of several magnetic, passive acoustic, seismic, underwater electrical potential, and water pressure sensors. Modern sensors use microcomputers that can sense a target's approach, determine whether the sensed signature is a ship or a sweep, and estimate the optimum time to detonate as the target passes by.</p>
<p class="ListTitle">CAPTOR</p>
<p>The CAPTOR (enCAPsulated TORpedo) is the U.S. Navy's primary anti-submarine naval mine. This deep-water mine is laid by ship, aircraft or submarine, and is anchored to the ocean floor. When its sonar detects a hostile submarine, the CAPTOR launches a Mark 46 torpedo.</p>

<p class="ListTitle">MK 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (SLMM)</p>
<p>Mine Mk 67 is a multiple-influence bottom mine with a capability that permits it to be covertly propelled to a predetermined planting location. Launched by submarine, its purpose is to restrict ship and submarine traffic.</p>
<p>The MK 67 SLMM anti-shipping mine is similar to a torpedo in that after it is launched it can travel under its own power to a remote location. The 1,765-pound MK-67 bottom mine uses a propeller which allows it to move independently into an area not normally accessible by mines.</p>

<p><strong>General Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Primary Function:</em> Destroy enemy shipping. The SLMM was developed as a submarine deployed mine for use in areas inaccessible for other mine deployment techniques or for covert mining of hostile environments. The SLMM is a shallow water mine consisting basically of a modified MK37 torpedo.</li>
  <li><em>Date Deployed:</em> 1987. </li>
  <li><em>Length:</em> 161 inches (409 centimeters) </li>
  <li><em>Diameter: </em>19 inches (48.5 centimeters) </li>
  <li><em>Weight:</em> 1658 pounds (754 kilograms). </li>
  <li><em>Depth:</em> Shallow water. </li>
  <li><em>Guidance System:</em> Magnetic/seismic target detection devices (TDDs). </li>
  <li><em>Warhead:</em> 510 pounds (230 kilograms) of high explosive. Type: Submarine laid bottom mine.</li>
