<p class="LargeTitle">Remotely Controlled Mines / Underwater IEDs</p>
<p>Command-detonated mines are moored or bottom weapons that are fired on order by the miner when the target ship enters the minefield. Command-detonated minefields are generally—but not always—limited to defensive operations in harbors or restricted waterways.</p>
<p>In the domestic context, mines and Underwater Improvised Explosive Devices (UWIEDs) are among many threats to U.S. maritime security interests. Terrorists can use or threaten to use mines and UWIEDs for a variety of political, economic, or military ends, often with psychological effects foremost in mind. While small devices might have no more than nuisance value, larger mines can be placed surreptitiously in channels and harbors to achieve spectacular effects—against, for example, ferries or cruise ships with several thousand people on board. And a coordinated mine or UWIED attack in multiple locations can have a debilitating, if not disastrous, economic impact.</p>
