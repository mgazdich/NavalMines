<p class="LargeTitle">Bottom Contact Mines</p>
<p>A bottom contact mine is merely a self-contained explosive device placed on the seafloor. They have been used against submarines, as submarines sometimes lie on the seafloor to reduce their acoustic signature. They are also used to prevent landing craft from reaching the shore and were a major obstacle during the D-Day landings.</p>
