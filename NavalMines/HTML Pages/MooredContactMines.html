<p class="LargeTitle">Moored Contact Mines</p>
<p>Moored Mines are assembled in buoyant cases and held in place by anchors. There are three types of moored mines: </p>
<ul>
  <li>close-tethered mines near the sea floor</li>
  <li>in-volume mines</li>
  <li>near-surface mines</li>
</ul>
<p>Moored mines require a large internal air space to allow the mine case to become buoyant, which limits the amount of explosives that they can contain. As a result, the damage radius of a moored mine is generally less than that of a bottom mine. Some moored mines, however, are armed with torpedoes or rockets that greatly increase the weapons' &#8220;reach&#8221; against submerged and surface targets.</p>
